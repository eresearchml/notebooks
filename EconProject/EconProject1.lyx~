Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The demographics of the UK is changing.
 We have a population that is living longer and the life expectatncy for
 men and women is predicted to be 93.5 and 96.5 by 2030.

Exploring the causes of mortality not only allows policy to be formed that
 more efficiently manages resources for this ageing population but also
 allows education of individuals to choose lifestyle choices that will reduce
 their risk of early death.
 In a developed country such as the UK, mortality rates at younger ages
 is very low so the most effective improvements in mortality come from focusing
 on the older population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Engish Longditudinal Study of Ageing is a study started in 2002 focusing
 on following a group of approximately 10,000 individuals over 50 years
 old.
 These individuals were in private residences.The questionaire explores demograph
ics, economic data( House hold income, Wealth, Pension, Employment, Consumption,
 Expectations (mortality, employment, income adequancy)) and health data.
 There has been a vast amount of research into the link between smoking
 and premature death.
 This survey also wants to see what life was like for individuals before
 their deaths.
 So a lot of the health data is concerned with how good the quality of life
 is for people prior to their death.
 This includes living with certain conditions, how ability to walk, wash
 and clothe oneself impacts of mortality.
 And how mental health affects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Health sections include, general health, Health behaviours (smoking), mental
 health, Mobility assement, blood analys, cognitive fucntions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information collected provides data about, household and individual
 demographics, Health pyhsical and psychosocial, work and pensions, income
 and assets, housing, cognitive function, social participation, effor and
 reward(voluntary work and caring), Expectations and walking speed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Questions being asked
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'd like to see what kind of socio economic effects are heavily linked with
 mortality.
 I think things such as income, savings, smoker status, social class, tv
 watching, alcohol, physical activity are related to mortality.
 My hypothesis is that perceived unhealthy behaviours such as tv watching,
 smoking, alcohol will be negatively correlated with mortality and percieved
 positive behaviours such as physical activity, income, savings and social
 class will the positively correlated with mortality.
 Such things as age and sex are already widely regarded as being negatively
 correlated with mortality and regards sex, women living longer than men
 so I'm trying to dig deeper than that for this project.

Q's to answer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
heterogenity - unintended variation across groups/participants
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea of linking mortality to socio economic factors is not new.
 The ELSA is a very rich form of data and.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fe analysis is used when interested in the impact of variables over time.
 FE is interesting when we want to explore the relationship between independent
 and dependent variables within an entity(group, country etc).
 We assume that something within the group may bias the independent or dependent
 variables and we need to control this.
 We assume there is a correlation between the error terms and dependent
 variables which is why we use FE.
 Fe removes the effect so we can assess net effect of indep on dep variables.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also those group characteristics are not correlated with another groups
 characteristics.
 If they are correlated we can detect with the Hausman test.
 This leads us to model the behaviour using random effects model instead.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fixed Effects model does not work well for slow changing variables or where
 there is minimal within group variation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This may be the model I use
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You could add time effects to the entity effects model to have a time and
 entity fixed effects regression model: Yit = β0 + β1X1,it +...+ βkXk,it +
 γ2E2 +...+ γnEn + δ2T2 +...+ δtTt + uit [eq.3] Where –Yit is the dependent variable
 (DV) where i = entity and t = time.
 –Xk,it represents independent variables (IV), –βk is the coefficient for
 the IVs, –uit is the error term –En is the entity n.
 Since they are binary (dummies) you have n-1 entities included in the model.
 –γ2 is the coefficient for the binary regressors (entities) .
 –Tt is time as binary variable (dummy), so we have t-1 time periods.
 –δ t is the coefficient for the binary time regressors .

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of smokerate is medidated by the differences across couuntries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By adding the dummy for each country we are estimating the pure effect of
 smokerate by controling for the unobserved heterogeneity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each dummy is absorbing the effects particular to each country
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FE model control for all time-invariant differences between groups so estimated
 coefficients cannot be biased by time-invariabnt charactertistcs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Random effects model the variabtion is random and uncorrelated with dep
 or indep variables in model.
 If we believe difference across entities have some influence on dep variables
 the use random effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Reasons not to use OLS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taken from a paper so reword
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

An application I will walk you through many applications of fixed effect
 models.
 Here is one to ponder.
 There have recently been high profile studies of the relationship between
 staffing in hospitals and patient outcomes.
 These studies use traditional OLS regression where the unit of observation
 is the patient, the dependent variable is some outcome measure like mortality
 (a dummy variable that equals 1 if the patient died in the hospital) and
 the key predictor is staffing (e.g., nurses per patient).
 These studies do not use fixed effects, and invariably show that hospitals
 with more staff have better patient outcomes.
 These results have had enormous policy implications.
 Unfortunately, these studies may suffer from omitted variable bias.
 For example, the key unobservable variable might be the severity of patients’
 illnesses, which is notoriously difficult to control for with available
 data.
 Severity is likely to be correlated with both mortality and staffing, so
 that the coefficient on staffing will be biased.
 (What is the direction of the bias?) If you ran a hospital fixed-effects
 model, you would include hospital dummies in the regression that would
 control for observable and unobservable differences in severity (and all
 other factors) across hospitals.
 This would greatly reduce potential omitted variable bias.
 None of the current research in this field has done so, perhaps because
 there is not enough intrahospital variation in staffing to allow for fixed-effe
cts estimation.
 Even a fixed effects model would not completely eliminate potential omitted
 variable bias.
 You must also hope that any changes over time in unobservable patient severity
 within each hospital are uncorrelated with changes over time in staffing.
 This might not be such a good assumption.
 As hospitals experience increases in severity, they may increase staffing.
 If so, then unobservable severity within a hospital is correlated with
 staffing and the omitted variable bias is still present.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All analaysis done using STATA 13
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) started in 2002.
 ELSA is a collaboration between Univeristy College London (UCL), the institute
 for Fiscal Sutdies (IFS) and NatCen Social Research.
 It is a large scale longditudianl panel study of men and women aged 50
 and over and their partners.
 They are living in private households in England.
 The orginal (Wave 0) participants were drawn from the Health Survey for
 England (HSE).
 Approximately 10,000 people are studies in each wave with the sample being
 refreshed in wave 3,4,6 and 7 due to people dropping out and death.
 Respondents were intervieved at approximaltey 2 yearly interviews, Wave1-
 March 2002 to March 2003, Wave2 -June 2004 - July 2005, wave3- May 2006-August
 2007, Wave 4 - May 2008-July 2009, Wave 5 - June 2010-July 2011, Wave 6
 May 2012 - June 2013, Wave 7 June 2014 - May 2015.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are concerned with mortality data which has only been updated until Wave
 6 as of this time.
 So we will concern ourselves with individuals who responded in the first
 wave and every wave up until their death.
 So there are not gaps in the data set.
 (Insert number here).
 When respondent die they can obviously no longer give responses to the
 questions in the data set.
 As the sample size is quite large we simply eliminate them from the group.
 (Maybe talk about possible biases to this)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The areas of interest and questions have been modified slightly throughout
 the lifecycle of the study.
 We will be focusing on questions that have been asked in every wave and
 who's question has not been modified significantly throughout time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As Wave 1 was the first full questionaaire we can only deal with mortality
 after Wave 1.
 So our time periods are mortality prior to Wave 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
 Which gives us 5 time series points corresponding to 2005, 2007, 2009,
 2011, 2013 approximately.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Why we take the log of the mortality 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As age increases the likelihood of dying increases.
 Over the age of 50 the probability of death follows an approximately log-linear
 link with age.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-3"

\end_inset

This is borne out in our data also.
 (Do the regression of age vs mortality rate)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our analysis we also want to see what effects our independent variables
 have on the log or mortality rate.
 So throughout our dependent variable will be log mortality.
 For example if something such as smoking would increase your probability
 of death in the next year then it follows that we should be regressing
 this against the log mortality rate.

Cycle of people more likely to die in december, if we have this data?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There tends to be a higher likelihood for people to die in december.
 This is quite a strong seasonal cycle.
 Even though the Uk is a temporate climate, poverty and ill health can lead
 to people not being able to heat their homes adequately in the winter which
 may lead to this spike.
 There's some evidence (find some evidence) that the winter fuel allowance
 should be increased to help alleviate this problem.
 But this is beyond the scope of this analysis.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Estimate methods to use & why appropriate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whilst the panel data asks a very broad range of questions it can never
 fully capture the variability between individuals either through variable
 being outside of the scope or inadequacies in the estimation procedure.
 We also suffer from only having 5 time data points to compare our sample
 over.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When trying to find predictors of mortality we face some difficulties if
 we analyze on an individual basis our dependent variable is binary and
 they become non respondent to the survey in the even of their death.
 This results in an unbalanced data set.
 So we need to form groups based on age, sex and class and perform fixed
 effects regression or random effects regression on them as this allows
 us to include variables that will absorb the variability in the groups.
 We will determine which one to use with the Hausman test and the LPG test?!
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As our respondents get older we need to account for the natural trend upwards
 in mortality by including dummy variables for each wave of the survey.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The theory behind fixed effects regression
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we believe the regression has the same shape within each of these groups
 over time, we can estimate the average of the regressions.
 The way fixed effects regressions handle this is to calculate the changes
 wrt to the mean of those changes within the group.
 So we want to know whether variations in mortality are related to variations
 in our effects.

\begin_layout Standard
We are trying to estimate coefficients of regression for a number of factors
 (listed above) but across a wide range of different groups.

This is known as fixed effects regression becuase it holds constant (fixes)
